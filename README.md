# Incremental-Data-load-with-Azure-Data-Factory
In this tutorial, use the Azure portal to create a data factory. then use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline that incrementally copies new and changed files only, from Azure Blob storage to Azure Blob storage. It uses LastModifiedDate to determine which files to copy.

### In this tutorial, I complete the following tasks:

- Create a storage account.
- Create a data factory.
- Use the Copy Data tool to create a pipeline.
- Monitor the pipeline and activity runs.
